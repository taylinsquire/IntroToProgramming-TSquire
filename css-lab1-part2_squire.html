    <h3>Shade loving plants</h3>


    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Cyclamen is one f my favorites, it blooms early in the season and is such a brilliant color it is hard to miss. I also love the delicate pattern on the leaves and the unusual shape of the blooms.</p>

    <p>The flowering trees are also a source of great enjoyment. I have a very scraggy wild plum tree which has 2 weeks of glory as it is covered in white petals. We also have flowering redbud and crabapple. The Queen of the Flowering Trees is the dogwood. I have 2, a white dogwood and "Cherokee Chief" which starts out red and fades to pink.</p>

    <p>Vertical-align can be used in all kinds of interesting ways

    Enjoy mountain spring - it's 105 times better than tap water!
    This means water provided through a municipal distribution system.</p>
